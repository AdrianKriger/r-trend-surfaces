# 1st- and 2nd-order Trend Surfaces

After understanding the need for _higher order interpolation methods_. we  can proceed. 
We start with the principles of trend surface analysis, a technique used to model spatial trends and variations in data and learn how to fit **1st and 2nd order trend surfaces** to a dataset and interpret the results to identify underlying patterns.
