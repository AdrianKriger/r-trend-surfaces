# Generalized Least Squares and Thin-Plate Spline

Next, we explore empirical smooth functions to analyze spatial data. We introduce different smoothing techniques, like the generalized additive model and minimum-curvature surface (thin-plate spline) to reveal trends and patterns in noisy datasets.
